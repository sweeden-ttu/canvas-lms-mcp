## Why this matters

Large language models and RAG systems frequently hallucinate or return outdated legal and governmental information. When they invent judge names, cite non-existent laws, or surface unverified court documents, the consequences can be serious: litigants receive incorrect advice, officials are misrepresented, and invalid ordinances are cited.

## Key ideas

- **Mata v. Avianca (2023):** Attorneys submitted court filings citing non-existent cases generated by ChatGPT. The court imposed sanctions. This case illustrates the real-world harm of legal citation hallucinations.

- **Stanford Law findings:** General-purpose LLMs produce legal hallucinations 58–88% of the time. Specialized tools (LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters) still hallucinate more than 17% of the time despite "hallucination-free" claims.

- **Our approach:** Build a validation pipeline that verifies content against authoritative sources *before* any AI system presents it to users. Every output includes provenance metadata.

## Summary

Verification is the guardrail. This project addresses the risk by ensuring information about legal news, judges, officials, elections, laws, court documents, and templates is grounded in verifiable data.
