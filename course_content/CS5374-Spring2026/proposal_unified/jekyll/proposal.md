# Project Proposal

[Full proposal document](../PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md) (Markdown)

## Summary

We hypothesize that a pipeline verifying content against authoritative databases will significantly reduce hallucination rates in legal citations. Experiments include baseline measurement, verification pipeline effectiveness, validator vs. post-hoc comparison, and security red-teaming.

## Syllabus Alignment

| Week | Topic | Project |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1–2 | Intro V&V, Adequacy | Problem definition, verification adequacy |
| 4–6 | Black/white box, Model-based | Output validation, pipeline validation |
| 8–9 | Graph-based, Fault localization | LangGraph, failure localization |
| 10 | Security testing | Red-team evaluation |
| 16–17 | LangSmith, AI evaluation | Tracing, hallucination metrics |
