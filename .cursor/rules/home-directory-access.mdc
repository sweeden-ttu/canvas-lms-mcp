# Access to /home directory

## Scope

This rule applies whenever you are instructed to access files or folders underneath the **/home** directory (e.g. `/home/cursor/...`, `/home/jck1278/...`, `/home/sdw3098/...`).

## Required: user context

Always include **context** as one of these local users:

- **cursor**
- **jck1278**
- **sdw3098**

When the instruction refers to a path under `/home`, determine which user owns or is associated with that path (e.g. `/home/jck1278/...` implies **jck1278**) and treat that as the user context for the operation.

## Required: login as that user before accessing

Before reading, writing, or listing files under that user's home directory:

1. **Login as that user** (e.g. use `sudo -u <username>` when running commands that touch that user's files, or ensure the operation runs in that user's context).
2. Do not access or modify files under another user's home directory without running as that user (e.g. `sudo -u jck1278 ...` for paths under `/home/jck1278`).

## Credentials: env_save in .cursor

Use the **env_save** credentials stored in that user's **.cursor** folder when login or authenticated access is needed:

- **Path:** `/home/<username>/.cursor/.env.save`
- For **cursor:** `/home/cursor/.cursor/.env.save`
- For **jck1278:** `/home/jck1278/.cursor/.env.save`
- For **sdw3098:** `/home/sdw3098/.cursor/.env.save`

The canonical source of truth for env_save content is `/mnt/shared/Shared/env_save`; the per-user `.cursor/.env.save` files are synced from there. Use the credentials (e.g. GitLab, GitHub, or other host/user/password entries) from the appropriate `.env.save` when performing actions as that user (e.g. git push, glab, or other tools that need authentication).

## Summary

- **Under /home** → identify context user: **cursor**, **jck1278**, or **sdw3098**.
- **Before accessing** that user's files → run as that user (e.g. `sudo -u <username>`).
- **When credentials are needed** → use env_save from `/home/<username>/.cursor/.env.save` (or the canonical `/mnt/shared/Shared/env_save`).
